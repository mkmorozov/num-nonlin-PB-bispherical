# num-nonlin-PB-bispherical

Numerical solvers of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation in bispherical coordinates, in the case of two nonidentical spheres. These solvers were employed in the numerical computations presented in the paper

"A generalized Derjaguin approximation for electrical-double-layer interactions at arbitrary separations"

by O. Schnitzer and M. Morozov. The solvers are implemented in Octave programming language (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and distributed under the terms of the GPLv3 license.
